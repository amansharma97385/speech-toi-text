Speech Recognition Web App with Flask
This is a Python-based web application that captures speech input using the microphone, converts it into text using Google’s speech recognition API, and displays the recognized text dynamically on a webpage. The backend is powered by Flask, a lightweight web framework, while the frontend is handled with HTML and CSS.

Features:
Speech Recognition: Captures your voice and converts it into text using Python's speech_recognition library.
Web Interface: Simple web page interface where the recognized text is displayed.
Error Handling: If speech is not recognized or there’s a network error, appropriate messages are shown on the webpage.
Prerequisites:
Before running the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Flask: For creating the web application.
SpeechRecognition: For recognizing the speech input.
Pyttsx3: Optional if you want text-to-speech conversion, though not implemented in this version.
Install the required packages:
bash

pip install flask SpeechRecognition pyttsx3
How It Works:
The application consists of a Flask backend that serves an HTML page.
When the user clicks the "Start Speech Recognition" button, the backend captures the audio via the microphone, processes it, and returns the recognized text back to the webpage.
The recognized text is then displayed in a readable format on the web interface.
